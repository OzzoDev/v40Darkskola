footer-prompt5: "the flames are too round and still dont look like actual fire, do you have solution for that?"

footer-prompt6: "im not happy with the result, is it possible to make a much fancier animation using javascript?"

footer-prompt12: "can you give me the full javascript code to implement the Bezier Curves option"

footer-prompt13: "looks good now but can you make the flames animate a bit slower?"
