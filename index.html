            Deathwing, also known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, is one of the most iconic and terrifying villains in the World of Warcraft universe. Once a noble Dragon Aspect charged with guarding Azeroth's earthly domains, Deathwing was corrupted by the Old Gods, transforming into a monstrous force of destruction. His madness and rage led to the shattering of Azeroth during the Cataclysm expansion. With his massive form adorned in elementium armor, Deathwing embodies apocalyptic power, leaving devastation in his wake as he seeks to unmake the world he once protected.
